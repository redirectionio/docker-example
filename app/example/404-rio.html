    <h1>An existing page that should not be displayed</h1>
    <p>
      If you happen to see this page, it is obviously that the agent is not working,
      or that you have not yet imported <a href="/rules.csv">the CSV rules file</a>
      to be applied on this demo project.
    </p>
    <p>
      Please note that you may have to wait a bit before the rules are applied -
      it can take up to 10 minutes on a free plan.
